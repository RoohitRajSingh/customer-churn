Telecom Customer Churn
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Assessment

Dataset: Cellphone 

Customer Churn is a burning problem for Telecom companies. In this project, we simulate one such case of customer churn where we work on a data of postpaid customers with a contract. The data has information about customer usage behavior, contract details, and payment details. The data also indicates which were the customers who canceled their service. Based on this past data, we need to build a model which can predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not.

You are expected to do the following : 

Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis report of the dataset along with the missing value treatment
Multicollinearity check and summarization of problem statement for business stakeholders
Logistic Regression Model: creation and interpretation of the results
Comparing the model performances using confusion matrix, GINI coefficient and  Kolmogorov Smirnov(KS-chart) along with the remarks on the best model
Actionable Insights for the business stakeholders
